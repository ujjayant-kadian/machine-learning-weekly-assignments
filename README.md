## 📝 Week 2: Logistic Regression and Linear SVM on Synthetic Data

**Overview:**  
In Week 2, I explored **Logistic Regression** and **Linear SVM Classifiers** using a synthetic dataset. The assignment emphasized decision boundaries and their behavior with extended feature sets.

**Key Highlights:**  
- 📊 **Logistic Regression Model:** Built a logistic regression model and visualized its decision boundary.  
- 🤖 **Linear SVM Classifier:** Trained a linear SVM classifier and compared its decision boundary to logistic regression.  
- 🧮 **Quadratic Features:** Extended feature sets with polynomial terms and visualized new decision boundaries.  
- 📈 **Evaluation Metrics:** Assessed models using accuracy and confusion matrices.

## 🧠 Week 3: Lasso and Ridge Regression with 3D Data

**Overview:**  
In Week 3, I worked on **Lasso Regression** and **Ridge Regression** with a 3D synthetic dataset. This assignment focused on the effects of L1 and L2 regularization on regression models.

**Key Highlights:**  
- 🧪 **3D Data Visualization:** Visualized the dataset in 3D with `matplotlib` to understand feature-target relationships.  
- 🔢 **Polynomial Features:** Added polynomial features to enhance model performance.  
- 📈 **Lasso and Ridge Models:** Trained both models with different regularization strengths and compared their performance.  
- 📊 **Cross-Validation:** Used 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate models and plotted prediction error versus regularization strength (`C`).

## 🤖 Week 4: Logistic Regression and kNN Classifiers with Cross-Validation

**Overview:**  
In Week 4, I conducted a full ML workflow using **Logistic Regression** and **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** classifiers on two datasets. The assignment focused on model comparison using **cross-validation** and **ROC curves**.

**Key Highlights:**  
- 🔢 **Polynomial Features for Logistic Regression:** Trained logistic regression models with varying polynomial degrees and regularization strengths (`C`).  
- 🤖 **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN):** Trained kNN models and identified the best `k` through cross-validation.  
- 📊 **Confusion Matrices:** Evaluated model performance with confusion matrices.  
- 🧮 **ROC Curves:** Compared model performance using ROC curves and AUC scores.

## 💡 Week 9: GPT-Style Language Model from Scratch

**Overview:**  
In Week 9, I implemented a **GPT-style language model** using **PyTorch**, focusing on **transformer blocks**, **multi-head attention**, and **text generation**.

**Key Highlights:**  
- 🧠 **Transformer Architecture:** Implemented core components: **Multi-head Attention**, **Feedforward Networks**, and **Layer Normalization**.  
- 🚀 **Training:** Trained on **Child Speech** and **Shakespeare datasets**, logging train and validation losses.  
- ✍️ **Text Generation:** Used the trained model to generate text sequences.  
- 📊 **Baseline Comparison:** Compared model loss against a uniform probability baseline.
